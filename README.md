## 👋 Hey, I’m Ifeanyi  

I’m a **Software engineer** who loves building clean, fast, and interactive web apps. I’ve been working with **React, Next.js, and Svelte** for 4+ years, and I enjoy turning ideas into smooth, responsive UIs that people actually enjoy using.  

I’m also curious about how **real-time communication** and **AI** can make the web more collaborative, so a lot of my projects mix those two worlds.

### 🔧 What I use most
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Svelte, Tailwind, Redux, Zustand  
- **Backend & DBs:** Node.js, Express, Supabase, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **Other stuff:** TypeScript, Docker, Git, WebRTC, Socket.IO  
- **Testing & QA:** Vitest, Playwright
