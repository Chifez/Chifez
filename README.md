# About me

Hi, I'm Emmanuel — a frontend engineer with over 3 years of hands-on experience crafting intuitive, performant, and scalable web applications. I specialize in modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Next.js, and Svelte, and thrive when working with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and component-driven architecture.

While frontend is my core strength, I’m equally comfortable building and integrating backend services using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Firebase, and Supabase — giving me full-stack agility when needed.

I’m a strong advocate for clean, reusable components and design systems that scale. I enjoy working in collaborative environments where ideas are shared freely, and where learning from others is part of the culture.

Let’s connect if you’re looking for someone who blends technical excellence with a passion for building delightful user experiences — or just want to talk shop about the future of web development.
